The interaction effect of spectral features improves the remote sensing retrieval of chlorophyll in cadmium-stressed rice canopy

The machine learning model in this paper is improved based on the original GAMI-Net model (https://github.com/ZebinYang/gaminet).
Thanks to the work of Zebin Yang et al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2021.108192)

It is recommended to use a conda environment and set Python to version 3.9.13, TensorFlow to version 2.11.0, and matplotlib to version 3.7.2. Additionally, replace the gaminet.py script with the one in this project.
